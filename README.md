# Ghost-Kitchen-Location-Analysis-Dashboard

### Problem Statement:
The rapid growth of ghost kitchens has increased competition, making it difficult for businesses to identify profitable locations. This project aims to analyze city-level restaurant data to identify high-opportunity locations for launching ghost kitchens based on customer demand, ratings, review volume, and competition intensity.

### Project Overview
• Identify cities with high demand but manageable competition
• Analyze customer ratings and total reviews to understand market behavior
• Compare cities to highlight top opportunities for ghost kitchen expansion
• Enable interactive exploration using filters and drill-down visuals

business_id – Unique restaurant ID

name – Restaurant name

city – City location

latitude – Geographic latitude

longitude – Geographic longitude

stars – Average rating

review_count – Number of reviews

total_reviews – Aggregated reviews
Data was cleaned and filtered to focus on food-related businesses only.
