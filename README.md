# Ghost-Kitchen-Location-Analysis-Dashboard

### Problem Statement:
The rapid growth of ghost kitchens has increased competition, making it difficult for businesses to identify profitable locations. This project aims to analyze city-level restaurant data to identify high-opportunity locations for launching ghost kitchens based on customer demand, ratings, review volume, and competition intensity.

### Project Overview
1. Identify cities with high demand but manageable competition
2.  Analyze customer ratings and total reviews to understand market behavior
3.   Compare cities to highlight top opportunities for ghost kitchen expansion
4.    Enable interactive exploration using filters and drill-down visuals

### Dataset Description

business_id – Unique restaurant ID

name – Restaurant name

city – City location

latitude – Geographic latitude

longitude – Geographic longitude

stars – Average rating

review_count – Number of reviews

total_reviews – Aggregated reviews
Data was cleaned and filtered to focus on food-related businesses only.
